## Hey!

I'm Annie. I recently completed a certificate in Applied Software Development with Dev Academy Aotearoa - easily one of the hardest (but coolest) things I've ever done. It gave me a solid tech stack and helped me grow more comfortable outside of my comfort zone.

Before Dev Academy, I spent five years as a business analyst in an IT environment. I was always fascinated by the developers and how they thought. A company restructure gave me the nudge I needed to lean into tech properly and upskill as a full stack web developer.

During Dev Academy we tackled a bunch of challenges (which you'll see some of below), but Iâ€™ve also been working on (and will continue to work on!) a personal project - Betty.

Betty is an app for pet owners to capture and track everyday health details to better prepare for vet visits and support improved outcomes. The idea came from my mum (a radiographer at a local vet clinic), who mentioned how hard it can be for staff to get accurate, thorough pet health history during appointments. Close friends of mine lost their pup, Betty last year - the app is named after her!

Feel free to have a look around and reach out with any questions!
